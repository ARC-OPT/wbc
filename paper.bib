    abstract = "{Parallel mechanisms are increasingly being used as modular subsystem units in various robots and man-machine interfaces for their superior stiffness, payload-to-weight ratio, and dynamic properties. This leads to series-parallel hybrid robotic systems that are challenging to model and control due to the presence of various closed loops. Most model-based kinematic and dynamic modeling tools resolve loop closure constraints numerically and hence suffer from inefficiency and accuracy issues. Additionally, they do not exploit the modularity in robot design. In this paper, we present a modular and analytical approach toward kinematic and dynamic modeling of series-parallel hybrid robots. This approach has been implemented in a software framework called hybrid robot dynamics (hyrodyn) and its application is demonstrated with the help of a series-parallel hybrid humanoid robot recently developed at DFKI-RIC.}",

abstract = {Constraint-based control approaches offer a flexible way to specify robotic manipulation tasks and execute them on robots with many degrees of freedom. However, the specification of task constraints and their associated priorities usually requires a human-expert and often leads to tailor-made solutions for specific situations. This paper presents our recent efforts to automatically derive task constraints for a constraint-based robot controller from data and adapt them with respect to previously unseen situations (contexts). We use a programming-by-demonstration approach to generate training data in multiple variations (context changes) of a given task. From this data we learn a probabilistic model that maps context variables to task constraints and their respective soft task priorities. We evaluate our approach with 3 different dual-arm manipulation tasks on an industrial robot and show that it performs better than comparable approaches with respect to reproduction accuracy in previously unseen contexts.}

ABSTRACT = {Regardless of recent advances, humanoid robots still face significant difficulties in performing locomotion tasks. Among the key challenges that must be addressed to achieve robust bipedal locomotion are dynamically consistent motion planning, feedback control, and state estimation of such complex systems. In this paper, we investigate the use of an external motion capture system to provide state feedback to an online whole-body controller. We present experimental results with the humanoid robot RH5 performing two different whole-body motions: squatting with both feet in contact with the ground and balancing on one leg. We compare the execution of these motions using state feedback from (i) an external motion tracking system and (ii) an internal state estimator based on inertial measurement unit (IMU), forward kinematics, and contact sensing. It is shown that state-of-the-art motion capture systems can be successfully used in the high-frequency feedback control loop of humanoid robots, providing an alternative in cases where state estimation is not reliable.},
