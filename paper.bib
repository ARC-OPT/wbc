abstract = {Constraint-based control approaches offer a flexible way to specify robotic manipulation tasks and execute them on robots with many degrees of freedom. However, the specification of task constraints and their associated priorities usually requires a human-expert and often leads to tailor-made solutions for specific situations. This paper presents our recent efforts to automatically derive task constraints for a constraint-based robot controller from data and adapt them with respect to previously unseen situations (contexts). We use a programming-by-demonstration approach to generate training data in multiple variations (context changes) of a given task. From this data we learn a probabilistic model that maps context variables to task constraints and their respective soft task priorities. We evaluate our approach with 3 different dual-arm manipulation tasks on an industrial robot and show that it performs better than comparable approaches with respect to reproduction accuracy in previously unseen contexts.}

ABSTRACT = {Regardless of recent advances, humanoid robots still face significant difficulties in performing locomotion tasks. Among the key challenges that must be addressed to achieve robust bipedal locomotion are dynamically consistent motion planning, feedback control, and state estimation of such complex systems. In this paper, we investigate the use of an external motion capture system to provide state feedback to an online whole-body controller. We present experimental results with the humanoid robot RH5 performing two different whole-body motions: squatting with both feet in contact with the ground and balancing on one leg. We compare the execution of these motions using state feedback from (i) an external motion tracking system and (ii) an internal state estimator based on inertial measurement unit (IMU), forward kinematics, and contact sensing. It is shown that state-of-the-art motion capture systems can be successfully used in the high-frequency feedback control loop of humanoid robots, providing an alternative in cases where state estimation is not reliable.},
