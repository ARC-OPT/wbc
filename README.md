# WBC Documentation

WBC (Whole Body Control) is an approach for specifying and controlling complex robotic tasks based on *constraints*. 
The term was coined by Luis Sentis in his phd thesis 
[Synthesis and Control of Whole-Body Behaviors in Humanoid Systems](http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.73.8747&rep=rep1&type=pdf). 
However, it is not limited to humanoid robot control, but can be 
used for arbitrary robot control tasks like dual arm grasping, force-position control, mobile manipulation.
