# WBC - Whole-Body Control

[Code API](https://arc-opt.github.io/wbc/index.html)  | [Full Documentation](https://arc-opt.github.io/Documentation/)

WBC is C++ library for optimization-based control of redundant robots. It allows intuitive specification and execution of reactive robot control problems that involve multiple simultaneously running tasks. 

WBC was initiated and is currently developed at the [Robotics Innovation Center](http://robotik.dfki-bremen.de/en/startpage.html) of the [German Research Center for Artificial Intelligence (DFKI)](http://www.dfki.de) in Bremen. It is part of the ARC-OPT (Adaptive Robot Control using Optimization) framework, which facilitates learning and optimizing whole-body controllers from data obtained, e.g., in user demonstrations. Also see the [ARC-OPT website](https://robotik.dfki-bremen.de/en/research/softwaretools/arc-opt/) of the Robotics Innovation Center.
