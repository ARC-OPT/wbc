# WBC Documentation

WBC (Whole Body Control) is an approach for specifying and controlling complex robotic tasks based on *constraints*. 
It was originally developed by Luis Sentis ([http://ai.stanford.edu/~lsentis/](http://ai.stanford.edu/~lsentis/)
in the context of humanoid robotics. However, it is not limited to humanoid robot control, but can be 
used for any robotic control task, like dual arm grasping, multi-legged walking or mobile manipulation.
